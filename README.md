Credit Card Customer Analysis
	
Credit Card Companies are facing a huge competition in the market space for having people take credit short time. The deals provided in the market space help the customer gain short term benefit for spending a certain amount on the card. This has been a major problem for our company.  So, we’re performing and analysis for credit card to recognize the patterns for credit cards to have long time customer and focus on retaining customer for a long-term benefit. 

Action Plan:
•	Credit Card Company is facing problems on loosing credit card customers.
•	Requirement of an individual to be able to recognize habits leading to loss of customer.
•	Study the statistics of patterns which affect the clients on regular basis. 
•	Proactively take measures to report problems and identify patterns
•	Take action by offering better services to retain the customer. 
The data set we used was from BOA, and we used a bank churners CSV file to utilize the data and collaborate for the action plan. 
Secondly, we looked at the data and found different categories of files to study and differentiate for the customer recollection. 
We found out a need for 20 different categories and based on that we used different models such as SVM, KNN, and logistic regression, 
random forest to find out the best performing model and have a decision-making process based on results.
There are different terms which we used in the coding to find out the customers spending habits and what they spent on for most of their expenses. 
There were 10 patterns where foods and travel were the most incurred expense, we saw in the models we created. 
Through which we utilized random forest to predict the best possibility of features which would help us give an open perspective for making our decision easier.
	The coding part was a difficult process to find out the best performing model we were getting a lot of errors to find out best performing model. 
  After a lot of errors, we came to a conclusion of our best performing model which was random forest as well with an accuracy of 95%. 
  Whereas the accuracy for SVM, KNN, and Logistic regression was 93%, 91%, 90% respectively. 
	For conclusion, we concluded that the female customers were the most reliable one who stayed long-terms and giving them credit
  boosted the highest of the revenue. 
  Furthermore, we also find out the people who were college drop out where most of the people to churn out from the credit card company. Giving them credit would be the number one consequence for not having the profit on the sheets. Lastly, college student were the ones who did not make payments on time and lead to long-term high interests rates which gave more revenue to the company.
